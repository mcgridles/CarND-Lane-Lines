Overview
---
The goal of this project is to identify lane lines in an image, and then apply it to a video stream. Check out [my writeup](writeup.md) to learn more about my process and see how it works.

Setup
---

Set up the [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/83ec35ee-1e02-48a5-bdb7-d244bd47c2dc/lessons/8c82408b-a217-4d09-b81d-1bda4c6380ef/concepts/4f1870e0-3849-43e4-b670-12e6f2d4b7a7) if you haven't already.

`source activate carnd-term1`

`jupyter notebook P1.ipynb`

Running
---
Once you have the CarND Term 1 Starter Kit up and running, everything should just work in the Jupyter notebook. Execute each cell to generate the output video.
